      <p class="about_p1">
        Hi, my name is Ayeshan and I'm 22 years old. I've always been a huge fan
        of movies, games, and TV series, and over time, I started to collect my
        favorite titles. It all started when I saw my first movie and was
        completely captivated by the story, characters, and overall experience.
        From that moment on, I became obsessed with discovering new titles and
        adding them to my collection. Over time, I started to expand my
        collection to include video games and TV series, which opened up a whole
        new world of entertainment for me.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="about_p1">
        As my collection grew, I realized that I wanted to share it with others
        who had similar interests. That's when I decided to create a website
        about my collection. I spent countless hours researching and designing
        my site to ensure that it showcased my collection in the best possible
        way. I added detailed descriptions, images, and reviews of each title,
        and even included some of my own personal insights and opinions. Today,
        my website is a source of pride for me, and I love being able to share
        my passion for movies, games, and TV series with others.

            Hello world! I'm Ayeshan, a software developer by day, and a
            code-crunching ninja by night. I speak fluent Java, Python, and
            sarcasm, and I'm always on the hunt for the next big tech trend.
            When I'm not coding, you can find me debugging my life and
            attempting to reboot my social skills. Let's connect and create some
            digital magic!
